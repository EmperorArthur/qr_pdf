# QR PDF
Store your files on paper, in a manner which is extremely recoverable.

Every file is broken into small, easy to read QR codes then saved to PDF pages.

# Installation

Primary installation is via pip.
`pip install qr-pdf`, however par2cmdline must be installed.

You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/Parchive/par2cmdline/releases).

## Rationale
There are other similar projects out there, however none of them did what I wanted.
Specifically the projects goals are:
* Provide a simple implementation
  * More complicated things may be included, but at least one simple reference should exist.
* Be decodeable without access to this tool.
  * It may not be as easy, but should be straight forward.
